Compilation:
	the normal one: make, then ./A3 puppet.lua
I completed A3 on gl42.

Manual:
The model I made is exactly the same as what is in the specification, no extra feature,
so it should have sufficient joint compplexity.
I included joint nodes in the structure, but I did not use them.
I created a menu for picking instead of color matching.
screenshot.png is included on the same level as A3.cpp
